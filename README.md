# Share Portfolio Tracker

A single user app designed to track the value and growth of a small share portfolio. The app also allows the user to search for and view the prices of further share prices and add them to the portfolio

The app was built on the MEVN stack as a group project on CodeClan's Professional Software Development Javascript Module.
